<h1>Growing the Mat</h1>
<p>After several days, the tea should have <a href="img_Mat.jpg">a thick mat</a> floating at the surface.  I usually shake the jars lightly around this point to wet the top of the mat.  The acid pH of the tea will prevent airborne mold spores from taking hold.</p>

<p>An underdeveloped mat at this stage may be caused by poor airflow or weak & insufficient starter, causing a slow ramp up.  </p>
