<title>Kombucha Guide</title>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I've been tinkering at making Kombucha since 2016 and the end product is now good enough that I've been asked to share the recipe.  These pages provide my basic procedure, along with some suggestions and cautions.  I hope you find it helpful.</p>

<h1>The Basic Process</h1>
<p>Kombucha is made by fermenting sweetened black tea.  The cycle is seeded with a "SCOBY" or "mother", a rubbery chunk of microbial mat.  Starter tea carried over from the previous cycle may also be added if available to speed up the process.  Left open to the air for several days, a new mat forms and thickens at the surface of the tea, producing yeast underneath and imparting a sour tang and fizzy texture.</p>

<p>A second ferment may be performed by adding more sugar and closing off the tea in a bottle capable of holding pressure.  The main purpose of this second round is to increase the carbonation, but fruits or other ingredients can also be added in small quantities to tweak the flavour.</p>


<h1>Schedule</h1>
<p>Timing is not especially sensitive.  The schedule stated below is typical, but may change a little according to conditions like temperature and such.</p>

<h1>Miscellany</h1>
<p>In summer months, the open ferments will attract fruit flies.  These can be trapped effectively using <a href="img_Trap.jpg">a small amount of water, dishsoap and cider vinegar</a>.  Foam the mixture (I use the kitchen tap on spray setting).  Lured by scent, the flies will fall into the foam and drown.</p>
