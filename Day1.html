<h1>Starting the Cycle</h1>
<p>I use <a href="img_Jars.jpg">large Mason jars</a> as my basic brewing unit (1.7L/58oz., wide-mouth lids, Bernardin brand, from Home Hardware).  Start with one and scale things up once you've got things working.  I usually make large batches sized to 5 of these jars.</p>

<p>Brew the tea in any suitably large pot.  A stock pot is great if you have one.  Use your jars to measure out the water and you'll have exactly the right amount of tea to fill them. </p>

<p>Use 3 teabags for each jar of water used.  You won't be drinking this tea directly and the process will mellow the flavour, so you can it steep as long and strong as you like.  I often leave the bags overnight when it suits me.  After removing the bags, add 1/2 Cup of white sugar for each jar of water used and stir to dissolve.  The quantities work out like so:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Water</th>
		<th>Tea</th>
		<th>White Sugar</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Large Mason Jar</td>
		<td>3 Bags</td>
		<td>1/2 Cup = 125mL</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 Cups = 500mL</td>
		<td>1 Bag</td>
		<td>3 tablespoons</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The tea must be allowed to cool before proceeding, since hot tea can sterilize the mother & starter.</p>

<p>Add starter liquid to the pot to help set the pH.  This can be strongly fermented tea from the last round if available, or white vinegar.  I carry over about a half jar of starter for each 5-jar batch I make.  This works out to about 10:1 fresh tea to starter.  It needn't be exact.</p>

<p>Add a small chunk of bacterial mat to each jar and fill them.  I like to keep the fill line around the shoulder of the jar, where it's started narrowing.  This way, as the liquid level falls slightly, the mat will be too small to completely seal off the liquid and it's easier to keep it moist on top.  Convenient tools for this stage are tongs & scissors for cutting the old mat and a funnel sized for preserving jars.</p>

<p>Cover the jars with something breathable.  Cheesecloth works fine in multiple layers, held by elastics.  I prefer fine wire screens though because they're more convenient, tidier, washable and I've had some cases where fruit flies worked their way through cheesecloth.  Wire screens may pose some higher risk of passing mold spores, but that's a minor issue.  I made my own screens out of food grade wire cloth with "30-Mesh" hole pitch (eBay). On early attempts I learned that disposable coffee filters don't allow enough airflow, evidenced by mats that grew slowly and tended to sink.</p>

<p>Store your jars somewhere in the open, like a corner of the counter or better, on the fridge where they'll be warmed a bit.  I found kitchen cupboards were too closed off, with the same symptoms as above indicating insuffcient air.  Avoid direct sunlight, but typical abmient room light is fine.</p>
