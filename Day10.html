<h1>Bottling</h1>
<p>Around 10-12 days the tea will have reached a nice acidity.  It can be consumed directly, stored in the fridge or bottled for a second ferment.</p>

<p><a href="img_Bottle.jpg">Grolsch style bottles</a> work best for a second ferment because they're made to hold high pressures and will vent if necessary.  I reuse commercial cider or beer bottles that I've purchased.  Be aware that these are not all created equal.  Some flip caps are designed only to be watertight without holding any aditional pressure.  These don't work well.  Small pebbles can be used to scour the inside surfaces of the bottles when cleaning.</p>

<p>Most of my bottles are 750mL, so that I can fill exactly two for each of the Mason jars I use in the first ferment.  I add 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar to these, or half a tablespoon per 250mL:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Bottle Size</th>
		<th>Sugar Added</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>375mL</td>
		<td>1/2 tablespoon</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>500mL</td>
		<td>1 tablespoon</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>750mL</td>
		<td>1 1/2 tablespoons</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 3/4L</td>
		<td>3 tablespoons</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Some favourite flavourings can also be added:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Flavour</th>
		<th>Notes</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lime, Orange, other Citrus</td>
		<td>Sliced thin to fit the neck of the bottle.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Currants, raspberries, blueberries.</td>
		<td>About enough to cover the bottom of the bottle.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lemon Ginger</td>
		<td>Thin slices or about a teaspoon of lemon juice.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cream Soda</td>
		<td>Molasses & vanilla.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sour Cherry.</td>
		<td>Chopped small while frozen.</td>
	</tr>
</table> 
</p>

<p>Fill your bottles to somewhere within the neck.  Before filling, I filter the first ferment tea with a sieve to remove pieces of mat and break up the yeast strings that tend to form.  </p>

<p>Remember to leave some amount of your initial batch unused, continuing its open air ferment with the mat intact.  This will become like vinegar, too strong to consume directly but well suited to use as starter for the next cycle.  You can vary this leftover amount a bit for convenience so you get your pressure bottles all filled exactly. Surplus mats can be disposed of.  I've never found a compelling use for them.</p>

<p>Leave the closed bottles at room temperature to ferment for 2-4 days, then move them to the fridge for long term storage.  Longer ferments can become explosively fizzy, like champagne.  Open these with caution.</p>
